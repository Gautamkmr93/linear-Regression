Problem statement::"we need to develop a model for salary prediction for an IT Professional based on their experience"

I have folloed the following steps:
-Import some packages(numpy,pandas,sklearn,matplotlib)
-read the dataset
-split the data based on the independent(x) and dependent variables(y)
-Divide the complete data set into training and testset
-Implement classifier based on linear regression
-plot the graph for linear regression.

Thanks
