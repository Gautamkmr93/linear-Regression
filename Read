Problem statement:"we have some set of data of salary for an IT Professional we need to create a simple linear regression model
based on experience"

I have used simple steps to create the following steps to solve the problem statement:
  1.Import some packages(numpy,pandas,sklearn,matplotlib)
  2.read the dataset
  3.split the data based on the independent(x) and dependent variables(y)
  4.Divide the complete data set into training and testset
  5.Implement classifier based on linear regression
  6.plot the graph for linear regression.
